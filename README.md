 Time series analysis is a powerful statistical technique that helps derive important trends and insights from sequential data. Time series data is a useful source of knowledge for decision-making in many disciplines, including finance, economics, engineering, and environmental science. To understand the underlying trends, seasonality, and other patterns in the data, time series analysis includes modeling and forecasting data points over a period of time. Time series analysis has consequently developed into a crucial instrument for companies and organizations to forecast future trends and make appropriate plans.

 In this project, I explore the principles of time series analysis and apply these methods to create a forecasting model for a real-world problem. We will learn more about the use of time series analysis to resolve complex issues and come to better decisions as a result of this project.
